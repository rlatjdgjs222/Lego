Give kids a rewarding building project, an exciting play experience and an eye-catching model to put on display with this impressive, hands-on LEGO Minecraft set. Upstairs is a dojo where the Minecraft warriors live and train. Downstairs is a blacksmith’s cave with an anvil, oven, armor stand and more for kids to craft and repair their weapons. Connecting the 2 levels is a trapdoor, operated by pushing a block beneath the tree. This spectacular set has got it all – even battle action, thanks to a marauding skeleton. And, when the player feels like a change, the levels separate and reconfigure to create a new play experience.</p><ul><li>Build, play and display – LEGO® Minecraft® The Training Grounds (21183) is a rewarding building project, an exciting play experience and a spectacular model for kids to put on show</li><li>Iconic characters – The set includes a classic cast of Minecraft® characters: a ninja, rogue, skeleton and a bat</li><li>Endless play possibilities – Kids can rebuild and reconfigure this wonderfully customizable playset again and again to explore imaginative play-and-display possibilities that never end</li><li>A stand-out gift – This modular playset makes an ideal birthday present, holiday gift, or special treat for any Minecraft® or model-making enthusiast aged 8 and up</li><li>Big on fun – Measuring over 9.5 in.
