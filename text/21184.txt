This activity-packed Minecraft playset is bursting with play possibilities. The cast of Minecraft characters includes a baker, snow villager, goat and a Creeper™. The busy bakery features a furnished room where kids can play out the home-life stories. Before the bread and cookies can be baked, kids must gather the ingredients. They get wheat by helping a farmer grow it. They get milk by milking the goat. Finally, they join the baker to get creative in the kitchen. For added excitement, a dreaded Creeper is lurking nearby and it is determined to destroy the chest with a valuable egg inside. Kids must defend the bakery using the classic Minecraft weapon, a diamond sword. When the battle is over, the modular set can be easily rearranged to inspire endless new adventures.</p>
