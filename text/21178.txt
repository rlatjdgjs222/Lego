<p>A busy day at the fox house<br>
Kids use their Minecraft skills to build a house designed like a sleeping fox. The structure’s open back and lift-off roof make it easy for them to arrange the furniture and enjoy imaginative role play inside. Outside there’s a baby fox, adult fox and Arctic fox for them to feed with berries before the animals curl up to sleep. A popular character from the game, the drowned zombie, arrives to wreak havoc. Kids must fend it off with a sword before exchanging it for a rod and enjoying a spot of fishing.</p><ul><li>Play-packed fun – LEGO® Minecraft® The Fox Lodge (21178) is bursting with characters, accessories and features to inspire endless creative play</li><li>Familiar figures – Includes iconic Minecraft® characters: a drowned zombie, fox, baby fox, Arctic fox and a hero figure in a fox ‘skin’</li><li>Creative and versatile – The structure’s open back and lift-off roof enable imaginative role play inside.
